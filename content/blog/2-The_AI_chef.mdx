Fascinated by the rapid evolution of AI, I began learning these mind-blowing technologies. I consider myself an elementary user of Large Language Models (LLMs); I simply type my request into the prompt and wait for the magic to happen.

Until recently, I figured there were so many new tools—like new spells—available, and I got confused about what the use scenario was for each. Instead of giving technical definitions for every term, I always prefer using an analogy to help me understand. As you may know, I cook a lot in my daily life, and today I will use a chef analogy to explain these terms.

## The Chef (AI Model)

Suppose the AI Model is the **Chef**. This chef has spent years in training (pre-training) learning how to cook. When a human (the user) places an order (the user prompt), the chef uses their internal brain to decide how to deliver the dish.

## Skill

A skill is the organized **manual** of the chef's specific techniques. While the chef "knows" how to cook, defining skills such as "peeling a potato" or "using a steamer" standardize their output. It is the model's internal capability library that ensures every time they "peel," they do it with a consistent, professional, and standardized way.

**Key Characteristics:**
- The model knows the skill in its memory. The skill document helps standarize the process. 

## Plugin

A plugin is the chef's **Internet Connection**. The chef knows the fundamental theorems of cooking but doesn't know a recipe invented this morning. A plugin allows the chef to download the latest recipe (through an internet plugin).

**Key Characteristics:**
- Fetches real-time data that wasn't in the model.
- Relies on a specific connection to a specific service.

## RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)

RAG is like a **private restaurant menu**. When the chef works for a specific restaurant, they cannot just cook what they like. Instead, they must strictly follow the restaurant menu (knowledge base). The chef must ensure the dish matches the restaurant's unique standards.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Allows the model to use sensitive internal data safely.
- Forces the model to use sources from the provided documents.

## MCP (Model Context Protocol)

An MCP Server is the **Universal Training School**. Different schools (Chinese, Japanese, Italian) have unique tools (woks, specialized knives, stove ovens) and specific strategies (stir-frying, baking, etc.).

The chef doesn't need to be an expert in every school; they just need a standard way to access the school's "Server." Once connected, the chef gains the Protocol to use those specific tools and follow the guided steps correctly.

**Key Characteristics:**
- The model (chef) can "ask" the server what tools (like specific knives or pans) are available.

## Agent

The agent is the **Executive Chef**. For all previous steps, a human had to tell the chef exactly what to do. But the agent figures out the "what" and "how" autonomously. You simply provide the goal: "I want a feast for my birthday party with friends from China, India, and the Middle East." The Executive Chef (Agent) then coordinates the tasks.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Autonomy.
- Iterative planning.
- Keeps track of what has been done (memory).
